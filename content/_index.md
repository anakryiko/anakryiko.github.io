Hi! My name is Andrii and this is my personal blog. I've started my career in
distributed systems, building
[EventStoreDB](https://github.com/EventStore/EventStore) from scratch, then
working on AWS Route53 service, and building serverless platform at Uber.
Eventually I moved into a lower levels of software stack, building profiling
tooling and ended up as a kernel engineer at Facebook. I'm currently working
on all things BPF, both in Linux kernel and in the user-space
([libbpf](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf), [BPF CO-RE](/posts/bpf-portability-and-co-re/)).
